# let-me-go-to-class
I want to go to class, but I don't want to check every 5 mins, this script will log you in, and then periodically refresh the class page and try and sign in to the particular class. 

It runs a chrome browser in headless mode, so it sits quietly in the background. 

The program will terminate when you have signed up.
